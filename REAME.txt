Rendering API :: Vulcan (Vulcan performs superior to openGL, occasionally better than microsoft DirectX, and works on all platforms (excluding apple devices))

apple devices will not be supported as compiling for apple platforms requires a mac device, and an apple developer permit (USD 100$ subscription)
